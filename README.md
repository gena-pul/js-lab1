# JavaScript Objects & Prototypes Lab

This lab explores:

- Function declarations, expressions, and arrow functions  
- Object literals and dynamic property access  
- Object.create() and prototype-based inheritance  
- Method overriding  
- A simple library management system  

Each part is implemented in a separate JavaScript file:
exercise1.js → exercise8.js  

Branches:
- part-1
- part-2
- part-3
- part-4
- bonus-challenge (optional)

All code runs in the browser console.
